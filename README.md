# djangocms-untranslated-placeholders
proof of concept for untranslated placeholders

1. create a virtualenv
2. python manage.py runserver
3. localhost:8000/?edit
4. admin / asdf
5. browse the "site". fr has no content at all, so there you'll see fallbacks or plugins from untranslated placeholders.
